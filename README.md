# Network And Security Bootcamp Final Project

# Tasks TO Be Done:

1. The network devices will be working as a dual-stack. So each networking device will be configured with both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity capabilities.
2. The routing functionality will be done by using OSPF protocol.
3. On both IPv4 and IPv6 backbones everything will be served from only the specified ports and every port exept those ports will be closed. Apply that with the Access Control List (ACL).
