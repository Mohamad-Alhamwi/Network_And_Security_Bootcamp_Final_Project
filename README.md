# Network And Security Bootcamp Final Project

## Tasks To Be Done:

- [ ] The network devices will be working as a dual-stack. So each networking device will be configured with both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity capabilities.
- [ ] The routing functionality will be done by using OSPF protocol.
- [ ] On both IPv4 and IPv6 backbones everything will be served from only the specified ports and every port except those ports will be closed. Apply that with the Access Control List (ACL).

## Project Phases:
The project will be done into 6 separate phases of work as the following:

**1. Phase:** Creating the base configuration for the devices.<br>
**2. Phase:** Configuring the backbone with IPV4.<br>
**3. Phase:** Configuring the backbone with IPV6.<br>
**4. Phase:** Doing the OSPF configuration on the IPV4 backbone.<br>
**5. Phase:** Doing the OSPF configuration on the IPV6 backbone.<br>
**6. Phase:** Restricting access to the only specified ports.<br>
